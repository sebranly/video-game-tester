# video-game-tester
This repository lists several indie video games I tested with pieces of advice to improve them. It doesn't focus on AAA games at all. For each game, it lists its pros and cons. It means that the feedback can be both positive and negative, but the overall goal of this repository is to be as constructive as possible in order to give every author ways to improve their projects.

- :calendar: **Release Date:** May 19, 2017

### Pros

:white_check_mark: Nice things:

- :earth_americas: Support in English and French on the website
- :arrow_up_down: Full-screen mode
- :necktie: The overall project looks professional
- :black_circle: Nice transition effects in the menu
- TBD Several difficulty modes available in parallel at the beginning
- TBD Several platforms for the game (Windows and Mac)
- :notes: Music in the background and sound effects for auditive feedback depending on actions
- :runner: Smooth animations (the player and enemies don't move tile by tile but pixel by pixel)
- :chart_with_upwards_trend: New enemies appear in the game (ghosts that are more powerful because they can go through bricks)
- :busts_in_silhouette: Lots of enemies moving at the same time on the screen
- TBD Several levels are memorable (e.g. level 20 for the end of Easy Mode)
- TBD For multiplayer mode, each player has their own display for lives/scores that they picked in the settings (percentage or absolute)
- :arrow_upper_right: Diagonal moves are possible by holding two keys simultaneously (e.g. level 36)
- TBD A real difficult mode with some decent challenge (the player has to really pay attention to his stock of bombs otherwise they can be stuck somewhere with no bombs left nor lives and die quickly like in level 51)
- :pencil2: Good level design
- TBD Display of objects is smart by showing them individually then showing `x10` etc. when over 9 objects
- TBD Holding the `Space` key spawns bombs indefinitely without having to spam the `Space` key
- :game_die: Skill-based game rather than based on luck
- :zap: No performance drop at all (it never slows down)
- :bug: No bugs at all

### Cons

:x: Things that could be improved:

- :earth_americas: No English support within the game
